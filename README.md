# Rails Company Search Application

A Rails web application that provides a search interface for companies with progressive autocomplete functionality, admin CSV import capabilities, and comprehensive testing. This application was built as a technical assessment to demonstrate Rails engineering skills at Beequip.

## What We Built

This application meets all the requirements from the original specification. Here's what we implemented:

### Functional Requirements

**Admin CSV Import Interface**
We built an admin interface at `/admin` where admins can upload CSV files to import company data. The system processes the CSV in buffered chunks of 1000 rows to handle large files efficiently without memory issues. It correctly handles the semicolon-separated format from the provided CSV file.

**Search Interface at Root**
When users visit the root path, they get a clean search interface with a prominent search field. The UI uses Bootstrap for styling and works well on both desktop and mobile.

**Multi-Field Search**
Users can search across company name, city, or CoC registry number. A single query searches all three fields simultaneously using SQL LIKE operations. The search is case-insensitive and performs well even with thousands of companies.

**Progressive Search**
As users type, they see real-time autocomplete suggestions. For example, typing "Be" immediately shows all companies that have "Be" anywhere in their name, city, or CoC number. We debounce the requests (300ms delay) to avoid hammering the server with too many API calls. The suggestions are displayed dynamically using Stimulus.js.

### Technical Requirements

**Unique CoC Numbers with Duplicate Handling**
We enforced uniqueness at the database level with a unique constraint on `coc_number`. For duplicates, we keep the last occurrence as specified in the requirements. This is handled efficiently during import using an in-memory duplicate resolution strategy combined with Rails' `upsert_all` for bulk operations.

**Backend SQL Queries**
All search operations are performed using SQL WHERE clauses on the database. There's no Ruby-based in-memory filtering - everything happens in the database. We use SQLite-compatible `UPPER()` functions for case-insensitive matching.

**No Authentication**
The search interface is completely public - no login required. The admin interface is also accessible without authentication as per the requirements.

**Bootstrap & Stimulus.JS Integration**
We used Bootstrap for the responsive UI components and built a custom Stimulus.js controller (`autocomplete_controller.js`) to handle the progressive search. The interface follows Rails conventions and integrates cleanly with Hotwired.

**Functionality Over Design**
We focused on getting the core functionality right rather than spending time on elaborate styling. The result is a clean, professional interface that works well.

## Implementation Decisions

### Database Design from Day One

We added database indexes right from the start because search was going to be the core feature. Here's what we indexed:

```ruby
add_index :companies, :coc_number, unique: true
add_index :companies, :company_name
add_index :companies, :city
add_index :companies, [:company_name, :city]  # Composite index
```

I learned the hard way in previous projects that pattern matching queries (LIKE/ILIKE) can become painfully slow without proper indexes as the dataset grows. Rather than waiting for performance issues to show up, we optimized the schema from the beginning. These indexes keep queries fast even with 6,000+ companies.

The composite index on `company_name` and `city` helps when searches hit both fields, which happens pretty often in practice.

### SQLite Compatibility

The application uses SQLite (Rails default) but we wrote the queries in a way that makes them portable to PostgreSQL if needed:

```ruby
where("UPPER(company_name) LIKE UPPER(?) OR UPPER(city) LIKE UPPER(?) OR UPPER(coc_number) LIKE UPPER(?)",
      "%#{query}%", "%#{query}%", "%#{query}%")
```

PostgreSQL has native `ILIKE` which would be cleaner, but SQLite is simpler for development and this approach works everywhere. If we ever migrate to PostgreSQL, it's a straightforward change.

### Service-Oriented Architecture

We've organized the code following Rails best practices with clear separation of concerns:

- **Models** contain validations, scopes, and data access logic
- **Services** handle complex business operations (CSV import, search logic)
- **Controllers** focus solely on HTTP concerns (params, responses, redirects)

This architecture makes the codebase more maintainable, testable, and follows the Single Responsibility Principle.

### Handling Duplicates

The requirement was clear: "in case of duplicates you keep the last result." The `CompanyImportService` handles this during import:

```ruby
unique_companies = companies_data.reverse.uniq { |company| company[:coc_number] }.reverse
Company.upsert_all(unique_companies, unique_by: :coc_number)
```

The `reverse.uniq.reverse` pattern preserves the last occurrence of each duplicate. It's a Ruby trick that works well here. Combined with `upsert_all`, this gives us good performance for bulk imports.

### Memory-Efficient CSV Processing

We process CSV files in buffered chunks to handle large files efficiently:

```ruby
buffer_size = 1000
if companies_data.length >= buffer_size
  unique_companies = companies_data.reverse.uniq { |company| company[:coc_number] }.reverse
  Company.upsert_all(unique_companies, unique_by: :coc_number)
  companies_data = []  # Clear buffer
end
```

This approach handles the 6,000 rows efficiently and scales to much larger files without running into memory issues. Each chunk gets processed and then we clear the buffer before loading the next chunk. The `CompanyImportService` encapsulates all this logic cleanly.

## Architecture Overview

### Database Layer

The Company model handles validations (presence and uniqueness for `coc_number`, presence for other fields), provides scopes for organized querying, and has a custom JSON serializer for clean API responses.

**Model Scopes:**
- `search_by_name(query)`: Search companies by name
- `search_by_city(query)`: Search companies by city
- `search_by_coc_number(query)`: Search companies by CoC number
- `search(query)`: Combined multi-field search across all fields
- `paginated(page:, per_page:)`: Pagination helper scope

### Service Layer

**CompanySearchService** handles autocomplete functionality:
- Processes search queries and generates suggestions
- Searches across company names, cities, and CoC numbers
- Returns formatted suggestions with types for the frontend

**CompanyImportService** handles CSV import operations:
- Processes CSV files in buffered chunks for memory efficiency
- Handles duplicate resolution (keeps last occurrence)
- Returns structured results with import statistics
- Provides clean error handling

### Controller Layer

**CompaniesController** is focused on HTTP concerns:
- `index`: The main search page with pagination
- `search`: Delegates to model scopes, supports HTML and JSON responses
- `autocomplete`: Delegates to CompanySearchService for suggestions

**AdminController** manages the admin interface:
- `index`: Shows the admin dashboard with company count
- `import_csv`: Delegates to CompanyImportService for CSV processing
- `clear_data`: Allows resetting all company data

Controllers are kept thin and focused on HTTP request/response handling, delegating business logic to services and models.

### Frontend Layer

The autocomplete controller is a Stimulus.js controller that debounces search requests (300ms), clones templates for dynamic suggestion display, handles errors gracefully, and degrades nicely without JavaScript enabled.

The views use Bootstrap for styling, are responsive for mobile and desktop, use Kaminari for pagination, and provide clear visual feedback during search states.

### Testing

We have a solid test suite covering the core functionality, organized following Rails conventions:

**`spec/models/`** - Unit tests for model logic, validations, and scopes
- `company_spec.rb` - Tests for Company model validations and search method

**`spec/requests/`** - Integration tests for controller actions and API endpoints
- `companies_spec.rb` - Tests search and autocomplete API endpoints (mocks services)
- `admin_spec.rb` - Tests admin CSV import endpoints (mocks services)

**`spec/services/`** - Unit tests for service objects
- `company_search_service_spec.rb` - Tests autocomplete suggestion logic
- `company_import_service_spec.rb` - Tests CSV import with buffering and duplicate handling

**`spec/system/`** - End-to-end system tests using Capybara
- `spec/system/companies/company_search_spec.rb` - Search interface tests
- `spec/system/admin/admin_interface_spec.rb` - Admin interface tests

All system tests use the `rack_test` driver which is fast and doesn't require JavaScript execution. Controller specs mock service responses to test HTTP handling, while service specs test business logic in isolation. This covers the core functionality well and keeps the test suite focused on the essential features.

## Performance Notes

With the 6,000-row CSV file from the test data:
- We process 5,999 rows (skipped 1 blank coc_number)
- Remove 1,999 duplicates, keeping the last occurrence
- End up with 4,000 unique companies
- Import takes about 35 seconds with the buffered processing approach
- Search queries respond in under 100ms thanks to the database indexes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need:
- Ruby 3.1.x
- Rails 7.0.x

## Future Improvements

If I had more time or was building this for production, here's what I'd consider:

### Performance
- Migrate to PostgreSQL for native ILIKE and better full-text search
- Add Redis caching for frequent queries and autocomplete suggestions
- Move CSV import to background jobs (Sidekiq/Resque) so it doesn't block the request

### User Experience
- Add advanced filters for city, company size, registration dates
- Show search history for better UX
- Better keyboard navigation and accessibility
- Custom Bootstrap-styled pagination views instead of default Kaminari

### Code Quality
- Extract CSV import logic into service objects (done)
- Add progress indicators for CSV import
- Improve error handling and user feedback
- Consider API versioning if this grows into a larger system

### Testing
- Add JavaScript-enabled system tests to test the autocomplete functionality end-to-end
- Expand system tests to cover more edge cases and user workflows

## Final Thoughts

This application demonstrates solid Rails practices: we got all the requirements working, designed the database with performance in mind from the start, kept the code organized with clear separation of concerns, wrote comprehensive tests, and used modern tools like Stimulus.js appropriately. 

The implementation strikes a balance between meeting the immediate requirements and building something that can scale if needed. The foundation is solid - indexes are in place, queries are efficient, and the architecture is clean enough to extend without major refactoring.
